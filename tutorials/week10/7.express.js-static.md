# Serving Static Files in Express

When building web applications, you often need to serve static files like images, CSS stylesheets, JavaScript files, and other assets. Express makes this incredibly simple with built-in middleware.

## What Are Static Files?

Static files are files that don't change based on user requests or server-side logic. They're sent to the browser exactly as they are stored on the server. Common examples include:

- CSS files for styling
- JavaScript files for client-side functionality
- Images (PNG, JPG, SVG, etc.)
- Fonts
- HTML files
- Videos and audio files

## Using `express.static()` Middleware

Express provides the `express.static()` built-in middleware function to serve static files. Here's how to use it:

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

// Serve static files from the 'public' directory
app.use(express.static("public"));

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server running on port 3000");
});
```

Now, if you have files in a `public` directory like this:

```
public/
  ├── css/
  │   └── style.css
  ├── js/
  │   └── app.js
  ├── images/
  │   └── logo.png
  └── index.html
```

You can access them in the browser at:

- `http://localhost:3000/css/style.css`
- `http://localhost:3000/js/app.js`
- `http://localhost:3000/images/logo.png`
- `http://localhost:3000/index.html`

Notice that `public` is **not** part of the URL. Express serves the files from within that directory directly.
