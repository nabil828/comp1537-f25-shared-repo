### 🛠 Express Middleware (`app.use`)

Middleware functions modify request/response before reaching the route. We have seen it before while parsing JSON and URL-encoded data for the request body.

```js
app.use(express.json()); // Parse JSON bodies
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true })); // Parse URL-encoded bodies
```

Custom middleware:

```js
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`${req.method} request to ${req.url}`);
  next(); // Move to next middleware
});
```

Common use cases for Express.js middleware:

- Logging: Track requests and responses.
- Authentication: Verify user identity.
- Error Handling: Manage errors centrally.
- Request Modification: Alter request data before reaching routes.
- Response Modification: Change response data before sending it to the client.
