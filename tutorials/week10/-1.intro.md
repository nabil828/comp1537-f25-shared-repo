In the early days, websites were small and static; just HTML pages.
But as apps became more interactive (think Gmail, YouTube, or Facebook), we needed two different kinds of work:

- One side focused on what users see and interact with.

- The other handled data, logic, and security behind the scenes.

That’s why we separated the frontend and backend; each does a very different job.

## Frontend

Purpose: Present data in a clear, beautiful, and interactive way.

The frontend runs in the browser.
It decides how things look and behave:

- What buttons you can click.
- How pages transition.
- How data (like your emails or feed) is displayed dynamically.

Examples of tech:

- HTML (structure)
- CSS (style)
- JavaScript (logic, interactivity)
- Frameworks like React, Vue, Angular

Example: When you click “Send” in Gmail, that button press is handled by frontend code that collects your message and sends it to the backend.

## Backend

Purpose: Process, protect, and serve data to the frontend.

The backend runs on a remote server.
It decides how things work:

- Authenticate users (login systems).
- Validate data and apply rules.
- Talk to the database and retrieve information.
- Return only what’s necessary (often as JSON).

Examples of tech:

- Node.js, Express, Python (Flask, Django), Java (Spring), PHP, etc.
- Databases like MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL

Example: When Gmail receives your “Send” request, the backend:

1. Checks your login session.
2. Stores your email in the database.
3. Delivers it to the recipient’s inbox.
4. Returns a “Message sent!” response.
