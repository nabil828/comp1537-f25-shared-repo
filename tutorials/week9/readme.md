**Vanilla JavaScript** refers to using plain JavaScript without any additional libraries like jQuery. It it called "vanilla" because it is the most basic form of JavaScript, without any added flavors or enhancements. While jQuery was popular for simplifying tasks in JavaScript, modern JavaScript (ES6+) has introduced features that make jQuery less necessary. Using Vanilla JavaScript directly can improve performance, reduce file sizes, and eliminate dependency on external libraries.
